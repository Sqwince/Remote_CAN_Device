/*OpenFFboard External Input Controller
========================================
Description: Reads Analog & Digital inputs 
and reports states over CAN to OpenFFBoard-Main
which hosts the motor driver and provides a 
single interface to the PC.

Supports OpenFFB SPI Buttons,
 Analog Axis (joystick, pedals, etc),
 and up to 4 rotary knob encoders


KNOWN ISSUE: Each Rotary encoder will consume 2 digital outputs from the SPI Buttons.
Unable to map more than 32 outputs to HID for some reason at the moment even
though the CAN digital frame supposedly supports up to 64 inputs.
